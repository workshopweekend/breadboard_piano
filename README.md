# Breadboard Piano

The Breadboard Piano plays tones as you move a wire between sockets on your breadboard. When you close one of five circuits, Arduino plays one of five different tones. By moving the wire between sockets, you choose which tone to play.

In the Arduino IDE code, you may change the notes to each wire, you may add buttons to the wires to make for a more simulated piano experience, and of course you may add more buttons and more notes to fill up your breadboard.
